      <h1>Linux Basics</h1>

      <p>There's a ton to be learned about Linux, but here are some useful commands for the general user. They're
        extremely important for Linux and Mac users, but are also handy if you're connecting to a Linux server from
        Windows (using a shell you can install like PuTTY or Bash).</p>

      <h2>Home Directory, Subdirectories, and the Root Directory</h2>

      <p>While searching for information about your Linux/MacOS directories, you've probably seen the squiggly "tilde"
        symbol like this: <span class="ilcode">~/Documents</span>. If you're wondering what the "~" means, it's just
        referring to your home directory (usually some variation of your name). So Scooby Doo's home directory would
        probably be "scooby", "scoobydoo", or "scooby.doo". (It's the account name, aka shortname, from when the
        computer was first set up.) If his home directory is "scooby" then his Documents directory path could be
        referred to in different ways:
        <br>
        <br><span class="ilcode">/scooby/Documents</span>
        <br><span class="ilcode">~/Documents</span>
        <br><span class="ilcode">/startup/Users/scooby/Documents</span>
      </p>

      <p>The root directory (not to be confused with the root user) is the only directory that's not a subdirectory. A
        subdirectory is just a directory that's within another directory (which is called the parent of that subdirectory). So
        the root directory is the parent of parents. In some MacOS installations, the root directory isn't visible by
        default in Finder (although there are ways to change that). But basically if you click "startup" or the computer
        icon (such as MacBookPro), you'll see the visible contents of the root directory: Applications, Library,
        System, and Users.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that 1) You shouldn't make changes in your Systems folder, and 2) there are several folders called
        the same thing (especially Library, User, bin, etc.) in different locations. Which brings me to the main reason
        I wanted to write this page...</p>

      <h2>Using Package Managers to Install Applications</h2>
      <p>When trying to quickly catch up with the latest technologies, one thing that that can slow you down is
        troubleshooting installations and dependencies. Package managers like Homebrew and NPM can help quite a bit.</p>


      <h2>Entering the $PATH Environment Variables</h2>
      <p>A lot of times after installing new applications, you'll need to set the $PATH variable so that you can run the
        commands from anywhere. The confusing part is that there are several places you can do this, and they all sound
        ridiculously similar.
        Luckily, you don't have to do it in each place.</p>
      <p>One thing to know is that they don't have to match...in fact sometimes they shouldn't match. For example, if
        your new installation of Python 3.8 shows in <span class="ilcode">usr/local/bin</span>, but <span
          class="ilcode">usr/bin</span> still shows Python 2.7, that's OK. The MacOs needs version 2.7 to run, so it
        should stay as is.

        Here are most of the locations of those directories (you don't really need to know all of these...I just like
        having the list handy):
        <br>
        <br><span class="ilcode">/bin</span>
        <br><span class="ilcode">/sbin</span>
        <br><span class="ilcode">/usr/bin</span>
        <br><span class="ilcode">/usr/local/bin</span>
        <br><span class="ilcode">/usr/local/opt</span>
        <br><span class="ilcode">/usr/sbin</span>
      </p>

      <p>If you've installed many programs, especially with a package manager, you probably have more locations than the
        ones listed above. And if you're troubleshooting a problem (such as not being able to run some programs from the
        command line), you might need to find more pathfile locations so you can doublecheck the path information stored
        there.</p>
      <p>This command shows your pathfile directories:
      <p><span class="ilcode">echo $PATH</p>


      <p>Here are my particular directories, but it varies from person to person.</p>
      <p><img src="images/sample_pathfile_directories.jpg" width="100%" alt="Sample Pathfile Directories"></p>
      <p>And here's a command that makes the results a lot easier to read!</p>
      <p><span class="ilcode">echo $PATH | tr ":" "\n"</p>

      <p><img src="images/sample_pathfile_directories_pretty.jpg" width="100%" alt="Nicer Sample Pathfile Directories">
      </p>

      <p>This person does a good job explaining $PATH environment variables, so I'll leave it to him (courtesy of Happy
        Belly Bioinformatics):
        <br><a style="color:#95C4D0" target="_blank" href="https://astrobiomike.github.io/unix/modifying_your_path">
          What the heck is my PATH, and how do I get it to do what I want?</a>

      <h2>Permissions</h2>
      <p>If you do an "<span class="ilcode">ls -l</span>" command or "<span class="ilcode">ls -al</span>" command to see
        the details when listing directories and files, you'll probably noticed a lot of code-like information on the
        left, like this:

      <p><span class="ilcode">-rwxrw-r--</span></p>

      <p>You don't normally need to worry about that information. It just indicates the permissions for those
        directories and files. But in case you're curious, here are some quick definitions:

      <p>- 1st slot (such as "-"): Indicates whether it's a directory (d), file (-), or executable
        <br>- 2nd, 3rd, and 4th slots (such as "<code>rwx</code>"): Define the owner's permissions
        <br>- 5th, 6th, and 7th slots (such as "<code>rw-</code>"): Defines the group permissions
        <br>- 8th, 9th, and 10th slots (such as "<code>r--</code>"): Define the permissions of others
      </p>


      <p>Here is what the -, r, w, and x stand for:
        <br>"r" - Read (accessing)
        <br>"w" - Write (editing)
        <br>"x" - Executable (running programs, including from the command line)
        <br>"-" - Denied
      </p>

      <p>If you get a permissions error when trying to run a command, you probably just need to precede the command with
        <code>sudo</code> (short for "superuser do"). The superuser is also known as the root user (unrelated to the
        root directory) and lets you authenticate so you can have the necessary permissions to do the command.</p>

      <h2>Final Notes</h2>

      <p>There's obviously a lot more you can learn and do with Linux, but this is enough to get you started. One more
        thing...if your CLI (like Bash or Terminal) doesn't look the way you want, it can be customized in .bash_profile
        (with a bit of work). For example, some people like to have a different prompt, rather than "$". I didn't like
        my prompt being on a separate line, and I wanted to always see my current directory. So if yours is driving you
        crazy, you can search online for help on editing your .bash_profile and be prepared for another adventure.</p>
