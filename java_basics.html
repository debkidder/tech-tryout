      <h1>Java Basics</h1>

      <p>Here's a bird's eye view of what happens in a simple Java program.</p>

      <img src="images/java_diagram.jpg" width="120%" alt="Java Example">

      <br>

      <p> </p>

      <h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
      <p>You've probably read that Java is an object-oriented programming language. But what does that mean? First,
        let's look at what an object is. In the diagram above, the Student class is used as a template to create three
        student objects. Each object has four properties and one method...all of which can be accessed from anywhere in
        the program.</p>

      <p>For a different example, let's say you take your car to get repaired. The mechanic enters your vehicle
        information into the system by filling in various fields (year, make, model, color, license plate, etc.). In
        other words, a Vehicle class constructor was used to create an object for your car with the various properties
        and methods. This object represents your specific car and carries with it all the relevent properties and
        available methods that might be needed at some point. (Which properties and methods can be accessed from which
        places in the program depends on their scope, described further below.)</p>

      <p>Here are four key principles of object-oriented programming. The examples are just intended to get across the
        main concepts.</p>

      <h3>Abstraction</h3>
      <p>To make code abstract means to make it more generic so it can potentially be re-used for other things. In the
        vehicle example, if I had started off by creating a Car class, then I would be stuck creating a whole other
        class for trucks and then another one for motorcycles. Initially, I might not mind copying/pasting all that
        code, but I'd have to do this every single time I made a change. And if I forgot, I'd have bugs. By abstracting
        the Cars class to a more generic Vehicles class, I don't have to create (and maintain) entirely separate
        classes...with ALL their properties and methods. I can just create one class...although I might want to create a
        vehicleType property and possibly some subclasses where I can make adjustments, described further below).</p>

      <p>The main benefits of abstraction is that it makes code more re-usable, which reduces a lot of copying/pasting
        and, more importantly, the amount of time needed to maintain code over the course of its lifetime.</p>

      <h3>Inheritance</h3>
      <p>Another way to improve re-usability is to create subclasses that extend the parent class (base class). This
        lets you inherit the desired properties and methods and then add additional ones that are specific to the
        subclass. For example, I could extend my class for vehicles (mainly used for cars, SUVs, and light trucks) by
        creating a subclass for motorcycles and a subclass for semi trucks. Or I could have a Vehicles parent class with
        subclasses based on engine type: electric, hybrid, or internal combustion. It all depends on what's most useful
        for your specific program.
      <p>

      <p>Like abstraction, inheritance allows you to reduce repetition, which makes code much more maintainable.</p>

      <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
      <p>When a subclass inherits from the parent class, we might need to change how some of the properties and methods
        work. So, for example, if we extend the Vehicles class by adding an ElectricVehicles subclass, we'd probably
        need to change how some properties work, like fuelType. And some of our methods might need to work in a
        different way.</p>

      <p>Polymorphism is having the flexibility to incorporate special handling (by overriding or overloading
        properties, etc.). This makes it possible to reuse code and still have it meet your needs.</p>

      <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
      <p>Remember, objects carry their information with them. It's kind of like a pet having a dog-tag, but with much
        more data, such as breed, markings, nicknames, and favorite treats. It might have information about current
        status (such as "wearing a cone" or "sniffing another dog") as well as information on how to do things, such as
        eating from the dog dish.</p>

      <p>But let's say you don't want ALL the information and capabilities to ALWAYS be available throughout the
        program. For example, let's say we have a method somewhere else in the program in the Family class, and in the
        Family class we have a method called drawFamilyPortrait(). Whereas we DO want that method to be able to access
        our Pets class for general information, we probably DON'T want that method to draw our dog in its current status
        (sniffing another dog). And we may want our dog's ability to eat from dog dishes to only happen in when it's HIS
        dog dish and NOT in situations where it would be another dog's dish instead.</p>

      <p>This is where encapsulation comes into play. Since we're using inheritance and abstraction to be able to re-use
        code in various parts of the program, we also need to be able to control the scope. So if properties shouldn't
        be accessible from other classes (such as if they only make sense in certain contexts), you need to be able to
        set the scope to limit the accessibility for your classes, methods, and properties. This is done with access
        modifiers: public, private, package (default), and protected. Read below if you'd like more detail.</p>

      <h2>What Does "public static void" Mean?</h2>
      <p>When first looking at Java code, you've probably wondered about the keywords <span class="ilcode">public</span>
        , <span class="ilcode">static</span>, and <span class="ilcode">void</span>. Understandably, most Java tutorials
        kind of skip over that and follow the traditional sequence of explaining programming (after the usual "Hello
        world," do some basic math computations, then explain variables and data types, and proceed to logic and
        conditionals). However, for anyone who wants a general idea of what they mean, here are some brief explanations.
      </p>
