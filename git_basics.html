      <h1>Git Basics</h1>
      <p>The complexity of Git can be intimidating, but it's a lot easier once you know which commands can be run at
        what part of the flow. The diagrams below will walk you through some common workflows. If you're not set up with
        Git yet, you might want to skip down to the "What's a Repository and Why Do I Want One?" section. There's also a
        table at the bottom with more commands.</p>

      <h2>What's a Repository and Why Do I Want One?</h2>

      <p>A repository (or repo) is basically a place to store the exact set of changes you want. Your finished code can
        sit over in a tidy pile (always ready to be deployed or shared), leaving you free to start construction on the
        next version. With Git, you'll have a "local repo" on your computer and a "remote repo" on GitHub. Remote repos
        can be set to either public or private, and you can specify the permissions needed.</p>

      <p>The best part of Git and other version control systems (VCSs) is that if you or someone else accidentally
        overwrites something, no problem...Git will help you get it back. Git is fairly complex, but that's so it can
        handle most any situation that comes up, such as when hundreds of people are working on the same codebase. No
        wonder it was created by Linus Torvalds, the same person who first came up with open-source software. When you're ready to try it out, skip down further below to see what's needed.</p>

      <h2>Creating a New Repository</h2>
      <p>Here's a basic flow for creating a repository (repo) for one of your own projects.</p>
      <br>
      <br>

      <img src="images/gitflow_create_repo.jpg" width=110% alt="Git Flow Create Repo"></p>

      <h2>Branching</h2>

      <p>Have you ever saved different versions of the same document so that, if something goes wrong, you can easily go back to the previous version? That's essentially what branching is. It lets you store a group of changes together without updating your main branch until you're sure you're ready. This is especially helpful for situations where need to change several different related files. For example, to update this page to say "Main" instead of "Master" (to reflect GitHub's change) I'm actually changing multiple files (the HTML file and image files), and I want to keep those changes batched together. That way, it'll be easier to revert if something goes wrong when I deploy.</p>

      <p>If you're just working on your own repo, after you've created a branch, made changes to it, and committed the changes, you can merge your branch into main before pushing it back to the original repository on GitHub. (However, if you're working with others on a shared repository, you'll probably be asked to follow a specific review/approval process before it gets merged. In those cases, find out what their process is and do some research on pull requests, etc.) 
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>

      <br>
      <br>

      <h2>Cloning (or Forking and Cloning)</h2>

      <p>When you're ready to start contributing to someone else's repository (such as an employer or
        friend), you'll probably want to "clone" the existing repo so that you'll have a full copy of the repo on your
        computer. Then you'll probably want to create a new "branch" for your changes. The specific steps you take depend on the branching strategy your company uses. But essentially, creating a branch gives you a place to store your new features while still retaining the main branch (sometimes called master) separately.  </p>
      <br>
      <br>

      <img src="images/gitflow_clone_branch_repo.jpg" width=110% style-"width:100%"
        alt="Git Flow Cloning and Branching Repo"></p>

      <p>By the way, if you're wanting to work on someone else's open-source project, the general guideline is to first
        "fork" their repository (which creates a copy of it in YOUR GitHub repositories) and then clone that new copy.
        Otherwise you might get a permission error later when trying to push changes back to GitHub. You can read their
        guidelines in the ReadMe file for that open-source repo in GitHub.</p>


      <h2>Getting Started in GitHub</h2>

      <p>To get started, you'll need:

        <!-- <ul style="list-style-type:disc"> -->
        <br>
        <br>- A GitHub account (they're free)
        <br>- A shell/CLI such as Terminal, etc. (already on Mac/Linux) or Bash (which can be installed on Windows)
        <br>- A basic understanding of some Linux commands (so you can run commands from the right directory, etc.)
      </p>

      <p>Then after a few configuration commands (see chart below), you should be ready to go. There are lots of
        tutorials available, and a list of the most common commands below (with examples).</p>

      <!--  -->
      <br>

      <h2> Handy Git Commands </h2>
      <p>You can run these at the command line, such as by using Terminal (or by installing Git Bash if using Windows).
        If using an IDE to work on your project, you can either use the command line or set up your IDE's GIT plug-in.
      </p>
