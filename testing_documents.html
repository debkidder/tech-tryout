      <h1>Test Documents: Agile vs. Waterfall </h1>
      <p>You've probably heard that Agile methodologies (such as Scrum) are more lightweight than the traditional
        software development lifecycle (commonly referred to as "waterfall"). Agile requires less documentation, so
        there's less time spent on writing, reading, and maintaining that documentation. And for companies/projects where Agile is a little too agile, there are alternative versions of it, such as SAFe. Also many
        companies use more of a hybrid approach. 
      <p>

      <p>Why doesn't everyone do full-on Agile? Getting to Agile requires commitment and company buy-in. It takes a
        mindshift, some training, trust, and lots of course-correction (which is a good thing). It's also
        incredibly easy to gradually slip back into waterfall habits. Also, even if a team is doing full-on Agile, there could be some projects that require additional
        documents.</p>

      <h2>Deciding on Your QA Approach</h2>
      <p>For those trying to decide on what QA processes to use, it's helpful to be open-minded and start
        small...focusing on what's actually most useful for your teams. With Agile, especially as trust is built up,
        there's less reliance on a lot of documentation, partly because of the added focus on informal communication.
        What should your team do? Like always, it depends on your specific situation. Here are some things to consider:
        <br>
        <br><b>Usefulness:</b> There will never be enough time to document how to test every single aspect of your applications, so how do you decide what falls off the plate?
        Always focus on what is most useful. Unnecessary documentation is not only expensive to create and maintain, but it takes extra time for others to sift through to find what they actually need.
        Thinning it down saves time for everyone, which frees time to do more testing or improve test capabilities with
        automation.
        <br>
        <br><b>Reusability:</b> Only use documentation that can do double and triple duty. It's not being lazy...it
        allows for more time to do the actual testing. It can also free up some time to build your team's test capabilities for future projects. Be open to different ways
        documentation can be presented. For example, test scenarios can be shown in a matrix with columns for tracking
        what tests have passed/failed or are blocked in which environments. It can be updated on-the-fly and can be an
        efficient way to track who is testing what. That matrix can serve as an informal test plan at the beginning of a
        sprint and can be modified on-the-fly as more test scenarios are added.
        <br>
        <br><b>Accessibility:</b> Try to keep documentation available where people can see the results for themselves.
        For example, if stakeholders can see a chart that shows only half the tests have been executed, they don't
        necessarily need a separate status report.
      </p>

      <h2>Traditional Test Cases</h2>
      <p>Creating a lot of detailed test cases can be expensive and time-consuming to maintain. Some companies create
        both Test Scenarios AND detailed Test Cases. To keep things lightweight, these can actually be combined and
        reduced. The first diagram below shows the traditional approach. It's much more documentation than recommended
        for Agile.</p>
      <br>
      <br>

      <img src="images/testcases_traditional.jpg" width=110% alt="Traditional Test Cases & Scenarios"></p>



      <h2>A More Agile Approach to Test Cases</h2>


      <p>To keep things useful and more maintainable, it's often helpful to use a lighter approach instead. You can use
        the test case titles as the list of Test Scenarios AND avoid entering detailed steps for every test case. The details are great (I'm all about details). But there's always an opportunity cost to maintaining overly-detailed test cases if they aren't actually getting used. They key is to put that time where it's needed and figure out where it's not actually useful.</p>

      <br>

      <h2>Documents for Agile and Not-So-Agile Methodologies</h2>

      <p>Here are some common documents used for different development methodologies. It's usually best to keep things
        simple and use only the documents that are truly needed (some of these documents are geared more for large
        projects or because of contractual requirements).</p>

        <p>The ones that are highlighted green/blue are the documents that are generally done (and are done by the QA team as opposed to the Product Owner/Product Manager, etc.).</p>
